- When adding two uniformly distributed random variables A and B together, what
  is the resulting probability distribution (i.e. what distribution is Y = A +
  B)? Ans: Uniform

- When you convolve two 1D square wave signals, what does the output look like
  as the two waves overlap? Ans: As the signals overlap, the output grows
  linearly to the area of overlap.
