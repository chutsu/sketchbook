- Given stride and kernel sizes for each layer of a (1-dimensional) CNN, create
  a function to compute the receptive field of a particular node in the
  network.  This is just finding how many input nodes actually connect through
  to a neuron in a CNN.

- Implement connected components on an image/matrix. Connect neighbors if the
  values were identical, or if the difference was under some threshold.

- How would you implement a sparse matrix class in C++?

- Implement a sparse matrix class in C++. Implement a dot-product method on the
  class.

- Create a function to compute an integral image, and create another function
  to get area sums from the integral image.

- How would you remove outliers when trying to estimate a flat plane from noisy
  samples?

- How does image registration work? Sparse vs. dense optical flow and so on.

- Describe how convolution works. What about if your inputs are grayscale vs RGB
imagery? What determines the shape of the next layer?

- Colorspace transformations and color-based segmentation (esp. talking about
  YUV/Lab/HSV/etc).

- Talk me through how you would create a 3D model of an object from imagery and
  depth sensor measurements taken at all angles around the object.

- You're in deep space with a star atlas and a calibrated camera. Find your
  orientation.

- Implement SQRT(const double & x) without using any special functions, just
  fundamental arithmetic.

- Given n correspondences between n images taken from cameras with
  approximately known poses, find the position of the corresponding 3D feature
  point.

- How do you rotate an image 90 degrees most efficiently if you don't know
 anything about the cache of the system you're working on?

- How do you most precisely and reliably find the pose of an object (of a known
  class) in a monocular RGB image?

- Implement voronoi clustering.

- How do you create concurrent programs that operate on the same data without
  the use of locks?

- How do you average two integers without overflow?

- Reverse a bitstring.

- "Talk to us about rotation."

- Project Euler #14.

- "How does loop closure work?" Followup: In a SLAM context, for do you make loop
  closure work even with very large baselines? (Say, anti-aligned views of the
  same scene.)

- Reverse a linked list in place.
