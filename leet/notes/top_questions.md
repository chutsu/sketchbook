# Arrays
- In an array 1-100 numbers stored, one number is missing how do you find it?
- In array 1-100 exactly one number is duplicate how do you find it?
- In an array 1-100 many numbers are duplicates, how you find it?
- Given two arrays, [1,2,3,4,5] and [2,3,1,0,5] find which number is not
  present in the second array
- How do you find the second highest number in an integer array?
- Given an array of strings, write an algorithm that returns an array of array of
strings, in which each subarray contains the strings of the input that have the
same set of characters, the same number of times. Eg: input ["art", "rat",
"tar", "artt", "are", "tart"] creates output [["art", "rat", "tar"], ["are"],
["artt", "tart"]]
